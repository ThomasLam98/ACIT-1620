			My name is Thomas Lam.I was born and raised in the greater Vancouver area. I am currently enrolled at the CIT program at BCIT. An interesting fact about me is: When I was 6 years old, my sister hit me in the face with a 9 iron resulting in a scar. The scar on my face is now a dimple.

			Things I like to do:
			<br />
			- Watch basketball 
			<br />
			- Cook food
			<br />
			- Relax at home
